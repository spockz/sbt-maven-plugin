  "body": "sbt-maven-plugin\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis is a fork from the plugin by [shivawu](https://github.com/shivawu/sbt-maven-plugin).\r\n\r\n### You should fall in love with it\r\n\r\n* Seamless mirgation from Maven to SBT, no rewriting in `build.sbt`, just import your `pom.xml`.  \r\n  BTW, a single-module project means you don't have to do **anything** except adding the plugin\r\n* Maven with SBT's awesome REPL\r\n* Use SBT without losing the richness of Maven's plugins\r\n\r\nWhy made this?\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nMaven is great stuff, while its choice of XML as its descriptor doomed that it's not good at describing _behaviors_. \r\nMaven's solution is using plugins. Maven has so many plugins.\r\n\r\nAs more expressive language coming on stage, like Groovy or Scala, programmers can use predefined DSL to better define _behaviors_.\r\nBy using the neat DSLs which Gradle or SBT provides, we can easily implement build system *tasks*.\r\n\r\nHow about, `pom.xml` for the model, and `build.sbt` for the behavior? Sounds great?\r\nAlso, `pom.xml` and SBT's cool REPL at the same time!\r\n\r\nI myself, wrote this plugin because Intelij IDEA has great Maven support, while plugins for others(Gradle, SBT) are all\r\n3rd-party. And let's be honest, they suck. If you're using SBT with IDEA, you have to reload the project, whenever your\r\nproject definition changes, but with Maven, it's just a fast update. \r\n\r\nBy using this plugin, you can just update your dependencies(or whatever) in `pom.xml`, and `reload` on your SBT console.\r\nCool!\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nAdd the following to `project/plugins.sbt`\r\n```scala\r\naddSbtPlugin(\"com.github.shivawu\" % \"sbt-maven-plugin\" % \"0.1.2\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr go the hard way, add the following code to `project/project/Plugins.scala`\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport sbt._\r\nimport Keys._\r\n\r\nobject Plugins extends Build {\r\n  lazy val root = Project(\"root\", file(\".\")).settings(\r\n  \taddSbtPlugin(\"com.github.shivawu\" % \"sbt-maven-plugin\" % \"0.1.2\")\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Single module project\r\n\r\n__See the configuration section above? Do that, and done.__ Just make sure there's a `pom.xml` in your current folder.\r\n\r\nI assume that if you're using this plugin, you will assure that `pom.xml` is at the same \r\nfolder with `project` or `build.sbt`. So, this plugin is designed that minimal effort is needed for users. \r\n\r\nThis is achieved by override the `settings` field in `Plugin` trait and this settings will be add to all projects' settings automatically.\r\n\r\nThis default behavior will be disabled **only when** there is module definition in `pom.xml` \r\nor any `MavenBuild` is instantiated from `.scala` build definition. (Here we took the advantages of `.scala` def is executed before importing `.sbt` def)\r\n\r\n### Multi module project\r\n\r\nDue to `sbt`'s design, multi-module project can only be defined in `project/???Build.scala`. Here, we use these settings:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport com.github.shivawu.sbt.maven.MavenBuild // Sorry for the long package name :-(\r\n\r\nobject MyBuild extends MavenBuild {\r\n\t// \"*\" is a selector which selects all modules\r\n\tproject(\"*\")(\r\n\t\t// Note that these properties like compile source, target, encoding \r\n\t\t// are treated as common properties. So set a pom.xml property \r\n\t\t// like \"<maven.compiler.source>1.6</maven.compiler.source>\" also works.\r\n\t\tjavacOptions ++= Seq(\"-source\", \"1.6\")\r\n\t)\r\n\r\n\t// Here \"a\" is a project id, which is set to the artifactId\r\n\t// BUT! SBT doesn't allow \".\" in the id, so the \".\" is replaced with \"_\"\r\n\tproject(\"a\") (\r\n\t\t// Project specific settings here\r\n\t)\r\n\r\n\t// Note that you can select multiple(but not all) modules using the \"|\" operator\r\n\tproject(\"b\" | \"c\") (\r\n\t\tassemblySettings ++ Seq(\r\n      \t\ttest in assembly := {}\r\n      \t)\r\n\t:_*) // Finally convert it to a Setting[_]*\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n* Project basic info(groupId, artifactId, version)\r\n* Neat API for both single module and multi module project(See _Usage_ section)\r\n* Dependencies and dependencies management from parent pom, including classifier, scope and exclusion\r\n* Multiple module project with inheritance and inter-project dependencies(module `a` depends on module `b`)\r\n* Properties resolution and common properties support(encoding, source level, target level, for now)\r\n* POM extra info(licenses, developers, ...)\r\n* Set scala version according to dependency declarsion\r\n* Read maven global repository settings from `~/.m2/settings.xml`\r\n\r\nLicenses\r\n--------\r\nCopyright 2012 Shiva Wu\r\nCopyright 2016 Alessandro Vermeulen\r\n\r\nLicensed under _Apache License, Version 2.0_.
