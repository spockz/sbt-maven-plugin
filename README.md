sbt-maven-plugin
================

Yoho! Finally, a SBT plugin for Maven

### You should fall in love with it

* Seamless mirgation from Maven to SBT, no rewriting in `build.sbt`, just import your `pom.xml`.  
  BTW, a single-module project means you don't have to do **anything** except adding the plugin
* Maven with SBT's awesome REPL
* Use SBT without losing the richness of Maven's plugins

Why made this?
--------------

Maven is great stuff, while its choice of XML as its descriptor doomed that it's not good at describing _behaviors_. 
Maven's solution is using plugins. Maven has so many plugins.

As more expressive language coming on stage, like Groovy or Scala, programmers can use predefined DSL to better define _behaviors_.
By using the neat DSLs which Gradle or SBT provides, we can easily implement build system *tasks*.

How about, `pom.xml` for the model, and `build.sbt` for the behavior? Sounds great?
Also, `pom.xml` and SBT's cool REPL at the same time!

I myself, wrote this plugin because Intelij IDEA has great Maven support, while plugins for others(Gradle, SBT) are all
3rd-party. And let's be honest, they suck. If you're using SBT with IDEA, you have to reload the project, whenever your
project definition changes, but with Maven, it's just a fast update. 

By using this plugin, you can just update your dependencies(or whatever) in `pom.xml`, and `reload` on your SBT console.
Cool!

Usage
-----

### Configuration

Add the following to `project/plugins.sbt`
```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.github.shivawu" % "sbt-maven-plugin" % "0.1.2")
```

Or go the hard way, add the following code to `project/project/Plugins.scala`

```scala
import sbt._
import Keys._

object Plugins extends Build {
  lazy val root = Project("root", file(".")).settings(
  	addSbtPlugin("com.github.shivawu" % "sbt-maven-plugin" % "0.1.2")
  )
}
```

### Single module project

__See the configuration section above? Do that, and done.__ Just make sure there's a `pom.xml` in your current folder.

I assume that if you're using this plugin, you will assure that `pom.xml` is at the same 
folder with `project` or `build.sbt`. So, this plugin is designed that minimal effort is needed for users. 

This is achieved by override the `settings` field in `Plugin` trait and this settings will be add to all projects' settings automatically.

This default behavior will be disabled **only when** there is module definition in `pom.xml` 
or any `MavenBuild` is instantiated from `.scala` build definition. (Here we took the advantages of `.scala` def is executed before importing `.sbt` def)

### Multi module project

Due to `sbt`'s design, multi-module project can only be defined in `project/???Build.scala`. Here, we use these settings:

```scala
import com.github.shivawu.sbt.maven.MavenBuild // Sorry for the long package name :-(

object MyBuild extends MavenBuild {
	// "*" is a selector which selects all modules
	project("*")(
		// Note that these properties like compile source, target, encoding 
		// are treated as common properties. So set a pom.xml property 
		// like "<maven.compiler.source>1.6</maven.compiler.source>" also works.
		javacOptions ++= Seq("-source", "1.6")
	)

	// Here "a" is a project id, which is set to the artifactId
	// BUT! SBT doesn't allow "." in the id, so the "." is replaced with "_"
	project("a") (
		// Project specific settings here
	)

	// Note that you can select multiple(but not all) modules using the "|" operator
	project("b" | "c") (
		assemblySettings ++ Seq(
      		test in assembly := {}
      	)
	:_*) // Finally convert it to a Setting[_]*
}
```

Features
--------

* Project basic info(groupId, artifactId, version)
* Neat API for both single module and multi module project(See _Usage_ section)
* Dependencies and dependencies management from parent pom, including classifier, scope and exclusion
* Multiple module project with inheritance and inter-project dependencies(module `a` depends on module `b`)
* Properties resolution and common properties support(encoding, source level, target level, for now)
* POM extra info(licenses, developers, ...)
* Set scala version according to dependency declarsion
* Read maven global repository settings from `~/.m2/settings.xml`
